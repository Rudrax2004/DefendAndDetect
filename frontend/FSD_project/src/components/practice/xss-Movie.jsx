            At the bottom of the page, you find an empty comment. This may seem harmless, however, if you reload the attacker's website, you will see that it grabbed your current query string:
            the actual attack happens when another user accesses that page of the vulnerable website. So, to simulate a different user, open another tab of your browser in incognito mode or an instance of a different browser. Then navigate to the vulnerable website and add a new review on the movie.

            You will notice that nothing strange happens on the vulnerable website. Your review is appended right below the empty one. However, try to reload the attacker's website. You will see your new review below the previous one:

            You may think that capturing reviews is not so interesting, since the review is public anyway. But consider what may happen if you, as the attacker, drop the following code snippet as your review on the movie:

            "As demonstrated, injecting JavaScript using HTML tags like <script /> allows attackers to send HTTP requests, potentially capturing sensitive user data. Other techniques, including CSS and direct JavaScript injection, pose similar risks.

            Upon injection, an empty comment may appear innocuous on the vulnerable website. However, upon reloading the attacker's site, the captured

            Now you have a clearer understanding of how Cross-Site Scripting attacks work. So, the next step is learning how to protect your application from them. You may have been realizing that the main reason for having an XSS vulnerability is the lack of data validation. So, you guessed that the primary defense against XSS attacks is distrusting user input. You have two main strategies:
